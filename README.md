This project aims to provide a set of general-purpose tools and features to assist developers building SDKs for third-party apps. Inspired by challenges faced at my current company—where SDKs are often developed without adequate support for debugging and logging during integration—this project was created to fill that gap. The goal is to offer reusable solutions that can enhance the developer experience and improve the quality of SDK integration across teams.
